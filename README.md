# QuotaScalingMoons

Lethal Company mod that *tries* to balance the loot and enemies on all moons (they are now free) and makes the funny numbers scale up with the quota.

By default, the moons in the first quota start at Experimentation level (which is configurable) and linearly go up to Artifice level and beyond around the 11th quota (which is also configurable). Cool!

Enemy spawn chance curves are currently always set to Artifice level.

### All players need to have the mod installed and identically configured.

(apart from scrap and enemy spawn related stuff, which is free to play with server-side)
