# QuotaScalingMoons
Lethal Company mod that *tries* to balance the loot and enemies on all moons (they are now free) and makes the funny numbers scale up with the quota.

Currently, the moons in the first quota start at Experimentation level (which is configurable) and go up to Artifice level and beyond around the 11th quota (which is also configurable). Cool!

### All players need to have the mod installed and identically configured.

(apart from scrap and enemy related stuff, which are free to play with server-side)

#### Known bugs:

- Single Scrap Day loot has incorrect value
- Apparatice has incorrect value

#### Future plans:

- Balance trap spawn chance curves
