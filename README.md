# QuotaScalingMoons
Lethal Company mod that *tries* to balance the loot and enemies on all moons (they are now free) and makes the funny numbers scale up with the quota.

Currently, the moons in the first quota start at Experimentation level (which is configurable) and go up to Artifice level and beyond around the 11th quota (which is also configurable). Cool!

### <u>All players need to have the mod installed,</u>

and the map size multiplier needs to be the same for all players to avoid funny desync.

#### Known bugs:

- Single Scrap Day loot has incorrect value
- Apparatice has incorrect value

#### Future plans:

- Implement enemy and trap spawn curve balancing
