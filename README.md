# QuotaScalingMoons
Lethal Company mod that *tries* to balance the loot and enemies on all moons (they are now free), while also making the funny numbers scale up with the quota.

Currently, the moons in the first quota start at Experimentation level (which is configurable) and go up to Artifice level around the 11th quota (which is also configurable). Cool!
